# nonempty

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Constructs a strictly non-empty structure that cannot be made empty.

## Installation

You can install the development version of {nonempty} like so:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jonocarroll/nonempty")
```

{nonempty} is dependency-free and relies entirely on S4 object
validation.

## Motivation

This blog post
<https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/>
makes the point that functions need to deal with edge-cases of inputs
being `NULL`. Even in languages without an explicit `NULL` (e.g. Haskell
has `Maybe`, Rust has `Option`) functions still need to deal with the
possibility of `Nothing`, `None`, or whatever the missing keyword is.

The example given there is a `head` function in Haskell, which is a
strongly-typed language and so needs to handle the output being either a
value, or `Nothing`, depending on whether the input *has* a first value,
or is an empty list (`[]`)

``` haskell
head :: [a] -> Maybe a
head (x:_) = Just x
head []    = Nothing
```

R, not being strongly-typed, doesn’t have a type-safe return value, so
it can return either a value, or `NULL`

``` r
head(c(3, 4, 5), 1)
#> [1] 3
head(NULL)
#> NULL
```

The alternative propsed is to use a nonempty type consisting of a
“definitely present” first value, along with a regular list (which may
be empty)

``` haskell
data NonEmpty a = a :| [a]
```

in which case, the return type of `head` can be guaranteed

``` haskell
head :: NonEmpty a -> a
head (x:|_) = x
```

This `nonEmpty` type has the benefit that it can be safely assumed to be
just that - not empty. Passing a `nonEmpty` structure to a function
would not require testing if it is currently `NULL` - it is not.

To that end, {nonempty} provides such a structure in R which attempts to
prevent being emptied.

## Usage

Creating a new `nonempty` structure is as simple as

``` r
library(nonempty)
a <- nonempty("path/to/my/data")
a
#> [1] "path/to/my/data"
validObject(a)
#> [1] TRUE
```

Note that you cannot create such as structure which is “empty”

``` r
a <- nonempty("")
#> Error in validObject(.Object): invalid class "nonempty" object: data has no characters, needs to have > 0
a <- nonempty(c())
#> Error in validObject(.Object): invalid class "nonempty" object: data length is 0, needs to be > 0
```

The data can (in theory) be any structure, but only vectors have been
properly implemented

``` r
b <- nonempty(c(2, 4, 6))
b
#> [1] 2 4 6
validObject(b)
#> [1] TRUE
```

`nonempty` objects can be combined, and remain (testably) non-empty

``` r
newval <- b + b
newval
#> [1]  4  8 12
class(newval)
#> [1] "nonempty"
#> attr(,"package")
#> [1] "nonempty"
validObject(newval)
#> [1] TRUE

combined <- c(newval, newval)
combined
#> [1]  4  8 12  4  8 12
class(combined)
#> [1] "nonempty"
#> attr(,"package")
#> [1] "nonempty"
validObject(combined)
#> [1] TRUE
```

The important aspect is that these `nonempty` objects cannot be created
empty, and cannot be made empty

``` r
# can't add NULL
nonval <- b + NULL
#> Error in validObject(e1): invalid class "nonempty" object: data length is 0, needs to be > 0

# can't substr to empty string
substr(a, 0, 0)
#> Error in validObject(.Object): invalid class "nonempty" object: data has no characters, needs to have > 0
```

The structure can be subset, provided it remains nonempty

``` r
b[1]
#> [1] 2
a[1] <- "some/other/path"
a
#> [1] "some/other/path"
```

but can’t subset or replaced if it becomes empty

``` r
b[NULL]
#> Error in validObject(.Object): invalid class "nonempty" object: data length is 0, needs to be > 0
a[1] <- ""
#> Error in validObject(.Object): invalid class "nonempty" object: data has no characters, needs to have > 0
a[] <- ""
#> Error in validObject(.Object): invalid class "nonempty" object: data has no characters, needs to have > 0
```

## Non-empty Structures in Dispatched Functions

Functions can now safely assume that a `nonempty` value is non-empty.

Say we had some critical function that takes a string `"file"`. We would
usually have to defensively code tests that this is non-empty. With a
`nonempty` class, we can rest assured that it is indeed non-empty.

``` r
critical_f <- function(file, y, ...) {
  UseMethod("critical_f")
}

critical_f.default <- function(file, y, ...) {
  message("writing file without checking that `file` is nonempty")
}

critical_f.nonempty <- function(file, y = 42) {
  # it is safe to assume that x is nonempty here
  message("writing y = ", y, " to file: ", file)
  writeLines(as.character(y), con = file)
}
```

The default way to programatically use the function would be to generate
some `f` containing the string, which could accidentally be empty

``` r
f <- "myfile.txt"
critical_f(f) # could accidentally be empty
#> writing file without checking that `file` is nonempty

f <- ""
critical_f(f) # bad
#> writing file without checking that `file` is nonempty
```

Alternatively, a `nonempty` value is validated to be non-empty

``` r
f <- nonempty("myfile.txt")
critical_f(f, y = 100) # won't be empty
#> writing y = 100 to file: myfile.txt
```

Any accidental emptying of the structure is prevented as it is
attempted, not as it is attempted to be used

``` r
# this immediately fails validation
f1 <- nonempty("")
#> Error in validObject(.Object): invalid class "nonempty" object: data has no characters, needs to have > 0
critical_f(f1) # f1 won't be empty
#> Error in critical_f(f1): object 'f1' not found

# this fails at the critical place
f2 <- nonempty("myfile.txt")
# [ ... ]
f2[1] <- ""
#> Error in validObject(.Object): invalid class "nonempty" object: data has no characters, needs to have > 0
critical_f(f2, y = 2) # f2 was never emptied
#> writing y = 2 to file: myfile.txt
```

## Limitations

This should run the validation on any `Ops` (`+`, `-`, …) operation, `[`
subsetting or replacement, `c()`, or `substr()` call, but there are
always other ways to make a variable empty.

Create a [GitHub
Issue](https://github.com/jonocarroll/nonempty/issues/new/choose) if you
find one and I’ll try to support preventing it.

*Q: Can’t you just overwrite a variable with an empty string?
i.e. `x <- ""`*

*A:* Yes.
